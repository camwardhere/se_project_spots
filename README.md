# Project 3: Spots

This is a responsive page. Interactive buttons with hover features. We could improve this page by providing URL that lead to certain sections or cards on the page.

HTML Techniques
Semantic HTML structure: You're using proper semantic elements like <section>, <ul>, <li>, and <form>
Form elements with accessibility: You're using <label> elements with proper for attributes connecting to input ids
Input validation: You're using type="url" for URL inputs, which provides built-in browser validation
CSS Techniques
CSS Custom Properties/Variables: I can see you're likely using CSS variables for consistent styling
Flexbox layout: Your modal uses justify-content: center and align-items: center for centering
CSS Transitions: You're implementing smooth animations with transition: 0.3s
Responsive design: You have media queries (though one needs to be cleaned up)
CSS positioning: Using position: absolute for modal close buttons
Background images: Using background-image for button styling
JavaScript Techniques
DOM manipulation: Using document.querySelector() to select elements
Event handling: Adding click event listeners with addEventListener()
CSS class manipulation: Using classList.add() and classList.remove() to show/hide modals
Form data handling: Accessing input values with .value property
Project Organization Techniques
BEM methodology: Your CSS classes follow BEM naming convention (block\_\_element_modifier)
Modular CSS: Separating styles into different CSS files by component
File organization: Organizing assets in dedicated folders
